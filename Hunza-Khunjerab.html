                <strong>Hunza-Khunjerab</strong><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p>
Get ready for a trip of lifetime. Buckle your seat belts for a roller coaster ride. In next six days you will travel on the eighth wonder of the world -the Karakorum Highway, which starts from Havelian and winds through beautiful spots including Abbottabad, Mansehra, Balakot, Naran, Chilas, Gilgit, Hunza, and Khunjerab National park. KKH connects China's Xinjiang region with Pakistan's Gilgit–Baltistan region in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at an altitude of 4,693 m/15,397 ft.
</p><p>During your journey you will pass through most amazing landscapes, lakes, glaciers, the world’s three famous mountain ranges — the Himalayas, the Karakorams and the Hindukush and valleys with breathtaking views.
</p><p>The British Backpacker Society identifies Pakistan as its top travel destination, calling it “one of the friendliest countries on Earth, with mountain scenery that is beyond anyone’s wildest imagination.”
</p><p>During summer you will spend one night at Naran, the fairytale valley - a tourist hub -famous for its scenic views and natural beauty.
</p><p>Lake Saif-ul-Malook
</p><p>Just six miles from Naran, Lake Saif- ul-Malook is one of the highest lakes of Pakistan, 10,578 feet about sea level. The only way to reach the lake is either on a donkey/mule or a 4 x 4 jeep because it’s located on the top of a steep hill.
</p><p>The history of this exquisite lake is much famous and attracts the tourists from all over the world. The story is about a prince, Saif-ul-Malook, who fell in love with a fairy princess, Badi-ul-Jamal.
</p><p>Saif-ul-Malook, a prince of Egypt, inherited a treasure from his forefathers, inscribed with two seals; one bearing the image of Said and the other one being that of Badi-ul-Jamal.
</p><p>When Saif saw the picture of the fairy he immediately fell in love with her. He left his home to search for her, in his long journey he finally met a saint who gave him a Sulemani cap, which could take the prince to his desired place.
</p><p>The saint told the prince that he would find the fairy in a lake but he had to pass several daunting exams and also pray in order to achieve her, as she was a fairy queen and prince was human. A human eye can never see a demon or fairy as they are “fire borne”, he was told.
</p><p>After passing several tests on the night of 14th he saw extremely beautiful the fairy queen with dark black hairs and radiant eyes coming along with her maids towards the lake for bath.
</p><p>She told the prince that she was trapped in a castle at Koh Qaf by a white giant for the past 10 years.
</p><p>After listening to the story of the fairy queen, Saif took her and tried to escape from this valley. When the white giant came to know of this he created turbulences out of anger in this lake, as a result of which flood came in Kaghan Valley, the both had to shelter in a cave near the lake.
</p><p>Legend has it that the Ansoo Lake in Kaghan Valley, a few miles away from Saif-ul-Malook, was created out of the tears of the white giant when he found out that the fairy was gone.
</p><p>The prince and the fairy queen still live, to this day, in that cave and dance above the water surface on the 14th night of every lunar month.
</p><p>In winters and early summer, when Babusar top is closed due to snow, you have to spend night at Chilas, a transit town in the ancient trade and pilgrimage route. It has Ladakh in the East, Kashgar in the North, Balakot towards South and Chitral towards West.
</p><p>Kunhar River
</p><p>Kunhar, river flows through the entire Naran, Kaghan, alhad, Balakot, Garhi, Habibullah and Dalola valley and it merges with Jhelum River right outside Muzaffarabad. Kunhar River is famous for its hydro power generation potential.
</p><p>Indus river
</p><p>Indus is one of the longest rivers in Asia, which originates in the Tibetan Palteau, and run through ladakh, India and enters Pakistan in Gilgit Baltistan area. It is the national river of Pakistan. During your journey you will see many colours of mighty Indus.
</p><p>River Indus has a total drainage area exceeding 1,165,000 km2 (450,000 sq mi), its annual flow of around 243 km3(58 cu mi), make it twice of the Nile river and three times of tigris and Euphrates river combined.
</p><p>Hunza
</p><p>After seeing the amazing landscape, rivers glaciers and snowy peaks, just after passing Gilgit, you will enter the northern territory of Gilgit-Baltistan.
</p><p>Situated on the riverbank and surrounded by glaciers and gorges, the Hunza Valley, often referred to as heaven on earth, enveloped in the grand Himalayas and the Karakoram mountain ranges, is home to snow leopards, markhors, ibexes, and red-striped foxes.
</p><p>Here you will see a whole new spectrum of colours and the landscape, freshness in air, and ambiance, which cannot be described in words.
</p><p>The villagers are very friendly and eager to help. They will make you feel at home.
</p><p>Despite severe shortage of plane land, Hunza people developed their agriculture system and have grown the best crop and yes, Hunza fruits are known as most delicious and unique. Watered with fresh water the organic apricots, cherry, nectarine, peach, apple, plum berry, grapes and pears have a unique taste, richness and nutritional value.
</p><p>According to many western researchers the secret of longetivity of Hunza people is its fruits and fresh water.
</p><p>Next to Hunza – amid rapidly changing landscape -blackish and forsaken mountains of Karakoram, there is this majestic lake, which came into being purely by chance.
</p><p>Attabad Lake’s vibrant turquoise waters came into being when a massive landslide at Attabad Village, blocked the flow of the Hunza River, in 2010.
</p><p>From Hunza onwards the entire area is called Upper Hunza or Gojal. The Gojal Valley borders China and Afghanistan, with its border meeting the Chinese border at Khunjerab — 15,397 feet above sea level — and remains covered with snow all year long.
</p><p>Before 1974, Gojal was part of the Hunza State, and was governed by the Mir of Hunza.
</p><p>Gojal’s Gulmit Village was the summer capital of Hunza, where the Mir of Hunza used to hold his court.
</p><p>Local music and dance programs were held here along with polo matches in spacious rectangular ground in front of the palace.
</p><p>The Mir of Hunza announced an affiliation with Pakistan, but it enjoyed autonomy as a separate state till 1974.
</p><p>In Z. A Bhutto’s era, Gojal became a Tehsil in the subdivision Hunza of Gilgit-Baltistan. Locally, it is also known as Upper Hunza, but officially it is Gojal.
</p><p>In the north west of Gojal, is Chiporsun, which border the Wakhan region of Afghanistan.
</p><p>After Wakhan, Tajikistan starts. It is a narrow strip of territory in Afghanistan that extends to China and separates Tajikistan from Afghanistan. Historically it acted as a buffer between the Russian empire and British empire (present Pakistan). Its eastern end bordered China's Xinjiang region, ruled by the Qing dynasty.
</p><p>Dry port Sost or sust is the last village in Gojal on KKH, before Chinese border. Before China border, is Pakistan's third largest national park, Khunjerab National Park, established to protect Marco Polo shep and snow leopards.
</p><p>The park was formally established in 1979 by the Prime Minister ZA Bhutto, who wanted to convert it into a world famous park.
</p><p>The final destination of the journey is pak- China border at Khunjerab pass, or darra-e-khunjrab in urdu.
</p><p>Its name is derived from two words of the local wakhi language. Khun' means Blood and 'Jerav' means a creek coming from spring water.
</p><p>The Khunjerab Pass is the highest paved international border crossing in the world and the highest point on the Karakorum Highway or KKH. The road across the pass was completed in 1982. The Pakistani segment of the Karakoram Highway starts from here.
